 * @file Circbuffer.hpp
 * @brief Library for circular buffer
 *
 * @note I intended to use boost::circular_buffer, but I cannot get it to work
 * with the compiler...
 *
 * @note This simple library is thread safe if
 * 1. the buffer size always larger than the content size (overriding in push
 * will never occur)
 * 2. there's only one writer (push) and one reader (pop).
 * when the previous condition cannot be satisfied, especially the first one,
 * just try to make sure that you don't peek too old messages
 *
 * @note this file also contain a copycat class. to use these two functions,
 * create a original class where only one task can add to it. then create
 * multiple copycats where you can pop(). each copycat act like a original, but
 * with no extra copy cost. and they won't interfere with each other. perfect
 * for duplicating streams of commands.

/**
 * @brief copycat class for circbuffer
 *
 * @tparam T member type
 * @tparam msize length of circbuffer
 *
 * @note this class is a copycat for Circbuffer class. On the back of one
 * copycat class, there must be a original Circbuffer, copycat will not store
 * data, but points you to the original.
 *
 * You can only access data of the original with copycat, but cannot write. The
 * goal of copycat class is that you can instantiate a copy without cost, and
 * then use pop() to keep track of where you left off.
 *
 * @note when you call pop() in copycat class, you virtually pop out the
 * data by moving the head pointer, but will not actually pop out the data in
 * the original. This means you can have multiple copycats popping
 * independently. Actually, this is the whole point of creating this class, you
 * can have multiple 'streams' of commands of the same actual data without
 * interferening with each other, which is really helpful for multi-threading:
 * you can have a copycat class for the stream you want in each thread and just
 * use them as a stream (queue), without the actual cost of copying multiple
 * streams (queues).
 *
 * @note Because we need to deal with multi-threading here, it's not possible to
 * check for size() before peek() or pop(). and I do not want to add a flag to
 * indicate this unless absolutely necessary. So instead I will assume that this
 * function can only be used with msgs, and for msgs, their timing information
 * can not be 0. What you should do is: check for timing information after pop()
 * or peek() to determine whether they are valid. Yeah I know, I know, this is
 * ugly, but it makes the interface cleaner. This implementation also means that
 * you cannot use this class for general class T unless you don't care about
 * multi-threading.
